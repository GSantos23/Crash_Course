# Exercise 3.10
# Every Function: Think of something you could store in a list. For example,
# you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or any-
# thing else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items
# and then uses each function introduced in this chapter at least once.
