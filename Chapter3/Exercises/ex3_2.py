# Exercise 3.2
# Greetings: Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. 
# The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

friends = ['Abigail', 'Andres', 'Oswald', 'Yose']

message = "How was your day, "

print(message + friends[0] + "?")
print(message + friends[1] + "?")
print(message + friends[2] + "?")
print(message + friends[-1] + "?")
