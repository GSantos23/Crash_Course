# Exercise 5.1
"""
Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement
describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. 
Your code should look something like this:
	car = 'subaru'
	print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
	print(car == 'subaru')
	print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
	print(car == 'audi')
	• Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line
	evaluates to True or False .
	• Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and 
	another 	5 tests evaluate to False .
