6-2. Favorite Numbers: Use a dictionary to store people’s favorite numbers.
Think of five names, and use them as keys in your dictionary. Think of a 
favorite number for each person, and store each as a value in your dictionary. 
Print each person’s name and their favorite number. For even more fun, poll a
few friends and get some actual data for your program.
